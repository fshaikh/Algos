# Tree Traversals
Inorder (recursive, iterative)
Preorder (recursive, iterative)
Postorder (recursive, iterative)
Level -order (iterative)
Determine levels for each node in a tree

# Tree Properties
Height of a binary tree (max depth )
Diameter of a binary tree
Minimum depth of a binary tree
# Path
Given a node, find the path of the node from root to the node

# LCA
Naive
Approach 2
Binary Lifting

# Sum Path Problems
- Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values   along the path equals the given sum.
- Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.
- Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.
    An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.
    Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
- Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf,      but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).



# BST
Search, Insert, Delete
Determine if a tree is BST
BST Iterator (implement next and hasNext functions)
LCA 
Successor, Predecessor, Minimum, Maximum

# Construction
Construct tree given its post and in-order traversals
Construct tree given its pre and in-order traversals
