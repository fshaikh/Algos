# Types of knapsack problems
 - Fractional - Can take fraction of an item. For eg: if an item weighs 4 kg and bag has 2 kg capacity left, one                 can put 2kg of item
 - 0/1 - Either we pick an entire item or not.
 - Unbounded - Similar to 0/1 except that an item can be picked unbounded times

 # 0/1 Knapsack
 ## Problem Statement
 Given a knapsack of Weight W, weights of each item , profits of each item, find the maximum profit
 by filling knapsack with items with the constraint that total weight of items put in the knapsack cannot
 exceed W
 Input: weights = [3,4,2,5], profits = [1,5,2,6], W = 6
 Output: Max profit
